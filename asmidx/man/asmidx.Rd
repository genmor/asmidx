\description{
Index and rank genome assemblies derived from the same set of reads using Shiny
}
\details{
Different genome assemblers and purging programs can output assemblies of
varying qualities in terms of contiguity, gene completeness, duplication, and
missassemblies even when working with the same set of reads. Despite this, no
single metric adequately embodies a "high" quality genome. Here, we designed
a Shiny application that will index and rank assemblies by user-defined criteria
and optionally user-defined weights.

The intuitive graphical user interface allows the user to upload a data frame
with an identification column and any number of genome attributes. The user can
select any combination of attributes that will either be feature normalized
such that either the attributes scores are maximized (i.e., attributes
wherein higher values are better) or minimized (i.e., attributes wherein lower values
are better). A sum from these normalized values will be calculated for each row
which is used to rank the assemblies. Each attribute can be differentially weighted
and the applied weights can be any number > 0.

Rankings are visualized using a lollipop plot, where the top two assemblies are highlighted.
The normalized data and the generated plot can be exported.
