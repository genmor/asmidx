\title{Convert summary_statistic file output from Inspector into a dataframe}
\usage{
insp_sum2df(path_to_insp_summ)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_to_insp_summ}{The absolute path to the *_summary_statistics output from
Inspector. The \* should be some sort of ID string}
}
\description{
Convert summary_statistic file output from Inspector into a dataframe
}
\details{
This function is best used in lapply to import and load multiple summary_statistic
files. This can be done by creating a vector of absolute paths to the summary_statistic files
or by aggregating the files into a single directory, setting that directory as the working directory,
and passing the list.files() argument into lapply. See examples for details.
}
\examples{
#write example output of a summary_statistics output from Inspector to the current working directory
cat(`Nmex03_ipa-np_insp_summary_statistics`, "Nmex03_ipa-np_insp_summary_statistics")
cat(`Nmex03_ipa-np_pd_insp_summary_statistics`, "Nmex03_ipa-np_pd_insp_summary_statistics")

#for a single file
insp_sum2df("Nmex03_ipa-np_insp_summary_statistics")

#for multiple files
do.call('rbind', lapply(list.files(pattern = 'summary_statistics' ), insp_sum2df))

The python program Inspector (found at: https://github.com/Maggi-Chen/Inspector)
outputs summary statistics for genome assemblies. Unfortunately, the output is not
a format that is convenient for reading into R. This function attempts to take this
output and convert it into a dataframe. It should be noted that the structural errors found
in this file is a tally (i.e., the number of times an error type was found), and thus
denoted in the dataframe with the prefix num_* (as in: number of error_type).

As of this writing (Feb. 3, 2023), Inspector does not name its output files with identifying information (by design).
For use with this function, the file must be copied and renamed with identifying information separated by underscores (_).
For example: specimen_assembly_summary_statistics
Note that if you need to use inspector-correct, then the files cannot be renamed (hence copying and renaming).
