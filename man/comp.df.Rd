\title{read in compleasm short summary}
\usage{
comp.df(path_to_compleasm_summary, assembly.name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{assembly.name}{name of the assembly on which the compleasm output is based.
If no name is provided, the outputted dataframe will not have an "assembly" column}

\item{path_to_compleasm}{file path to compleasm summary output}
}
\description{
read in compleasm short summary
}
\details{
compleasm is a faster, more sensitive rewrite of BUSCO. The short summary
is similar to that of BUSCO, but it's more streamlined, and contains a new category
of fragmented single copy ortholog (I)
}
\examples{
# write sample compleasm summary outputs to the current
cat('compleasm_summary1.txt', file = 'compleasm_summary1.txt')
cat('compleasm_summary2.txt', file = 'compleasm_summary2.txt')

#to read in single compleasm summary output
comp.df('compleasm_summary1.txt')

comp.df('compleasm_summary1.txt', asssembly.name = 'TEST')

#to read in multiple, simply wrap comp.df() in lapply() and use do.call('rbind')
#to output a single dataframe with multiple rows.
#Assuming that compleasm summary files are in the current working directory:

#note that the example compleasm summary outputs are named 'compleasm_summary'
#read in all compleasm summary files as a list
df<-lapply(list.files(pattern = 'compleasm_'), comp.df)

#bind the list of compleasm summary dataframes into a single dataframe
df<-do.call('rbind', df)

#since it would be useful to know which summary output each row corresponds to
#create a new column that contains file names
df$file<-list.files(pattern = 'compleasm_')
